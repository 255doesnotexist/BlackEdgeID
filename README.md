# BlackEdgeID üé•üîç

## Introduction
**BlackEdgeID** is an advanced video processing tool designed to detect black edges in videos, thereby identifying improper aspect ratios. Utilizing cutting-edge image processing technology, this project offers a swift and reliable solution for content creators and media professionals.

## Features ‚ù§Ô∏è
- **Fast Uploads**: Built with FastAPI, the server-side can quickly receive uploaded video files.
- **Intelligent Detection**: Smartly identifies unsightly black edges by analyzing pixel changes over time in video frames.
- **Real-Time Queries**: Provides a real-time query interface, allowing users to check the video processing status and black edge detection results at any time.
- **Efficient Storage**: Employs Redis for efficient management of video files and processing results.

## Technology Stack üìù
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs.
- **ffmpeg**: A powerful multimedia framework for processing video and audio files.
- **OpenCV**: An open-source computer vision library for image processing and video analysis.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.
